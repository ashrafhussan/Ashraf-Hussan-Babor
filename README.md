Hi, I’m Ashraf Hussan Babor

I am an MSc graduate in IT with Data Analytics with a background in data analysis, machine learning (academic), and IT support. My work focuses on applying data-driven methods to solve practical problems, with an emphasis on understanding, evaluating, and explaining model behaviour.

During my MSc at the University of the West of Scotland, I worked on machine learning models including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Neural Networks using Python. I have experience with data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model evaluation, and explainability techniques such as SHAP and LIME.

Alongside my academic work, I have professional experience in a customer-facing IT support role, where I handled technical issues, managed support tickets, and communicated solutions clearly to non-technical users. This has strengthened my troubleshooting skills and practical understanding of real-world IT environments.
